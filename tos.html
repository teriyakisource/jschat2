<br>
<br>Note: This product is intended to be used at school with school emails to avoid impersonation and anonymity. 
<br>
<br>1. Be respectful and keep it civil
<br>Disagreeing with users is fine, but name calling, harassment and personal attacks are not.
<br>
<br>2. No religious or political debate
<br>Keep these opinions to yourself.
<br>
<br>3. No racism, sexism, bigotry, hateful speech etc.
<br>If someone can screenshot your message and make the website look bad, it will be removed, and you will be banned.
<br>
<br>4. No “edgy” / problematic jokes

<br>
<br>5. No illegal content of any kind

<br>
<br>6. No NSFW content of any kind
<br>I'm surprised I need to say this
<br>
<br>7. No swearing or slurs of any kind
<br>Swearing is an easy way to trigger the school's monitoring system
<br>Once this occurs, the school will be able to log all the onscreen data. 
<br>
<br>8. No impersonation of any kind
<br>Claiming to be a person you are not is strictly prohibited, both by law, and by our terms of service
<br>This includes being anonymous and telling people that you are a person which you are not
<br>Using an username that will cause people to think you are another individual is also problematic
<br>
<br>9. Follow the school's acceptable use policy
<br>
<br>
<br>^^^FAILIURE TO COMPLY WITH ABOVE RULES WILL LIKELY RESULT IN A BAN DEPENDING ON THE OFFENSE^^^
<br>
<br>^^^SOME MORE SERIOUS CASES WILL RESULT IN THE INVOLVMENT OF THE SCHOOL^^^</p>
