  <br>
  <br>Note: This product is intended to be used at school with school emails to avoid impersonation and anonymity. 
  <br>
  <br>1. Be respectful and keep it civil
  <br>Disagreeing with users is fine, but name calling, harassment and personal attacks are not.
  <br>
  <br>2. No religious or political debate
  <br>Keep these opinions to yourself.
  <br>
  <br>3. No racism, sexism, bigotry, hateful speech etc.
  <br>If someone can screenshot your message and make the website look bad, it will be removed, and you will be banned.
  <br>
  <br>4. No “edgy” / problematic jokes
  <br>Examples include but are not limited to; joking about beating women, race relations, pedophilia, or rape.
  <br>
  <br>5. No illegal content of any kind
  <br>This includes sharing pirated software or games. 
  <br>
  <br>6. No NSFW content of any kind
  <br>I'm surprised I need to say this
  <br>
  <br>7. No swearing or slurs of any kind
  <br>Swearing is an easy way to trigger the school's monitoring system
  <br>Once this occurs, the school will be able to log all the onscreen data. 
  <br>
  <br>8. No impersonation of any kind
  <br>Claiming to be a person you are not is strictly prohibited, both by law, and by our terms of service
  <br>This includes being anonymous and telling people that you are a person which you are not
  <br>Using an username that will cause people to think you are another individual is also problematic
  <br>
  <br>9. Refrain from making too many rooms unnecessarily
  <br>Most empty/inactive rooms are likely to be deleted
  <br>
  <br>10. Follow the school's policies
  <br>This includes policies like the acceptable use policy
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>FAILIURE TO COMPLY WITH ABOVE RULES WILL LIKELY RESULT IN A BAN/TEMP BAN DEPENDING ON THE OFFENSE
  <br>
